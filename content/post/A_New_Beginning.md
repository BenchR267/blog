Year after year I thought about aspects that I could possibly change to create a **more positive** lifestyle. These were often things like '*eat healthier*', '*do more sports*', '*quit smoking*' and so on. None of those actually ever happened *(beside the smoking, but that wasn't at New Year's Eve)*. And that's the point about resolutions. They never happen if you choose another time for it than **now**. Don't let yourself restrict too much from events like New Year's Eve..

So this year I want to try something else. It's nothing new though, but something **challenging** I want to aim to get a deeper understanding about. I got inspired by [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.facebook.com/zuck) who creates challenges for himself every year. I followed those on his Facebook account during the last years. He challenged himself with projects like '*read a book every week*', '*learn Mandarin*' or from this year: ['*build an AI like Jarvis from Iron Man*'](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10154361492931634/). Those are **measurable accomplishments** and - most importantly - projects that **advance yourself**, I'm talking about real challenges here.

So I sat down and started to think about projects I can accomplish during a year. A very important aspect of those challenges is to be **realistic**. A year might be a long time, but actually not as long as it seems at the beginning. Especially when you think about something you want to achieve during that time while working for a company and studying for your masters degree (like I do currently).

Let's have a look at two projects that came to my mind:

1. I want to write a **blog post every week**.
2. I want to create an **own programming language** (with compiler/interpreter-toolchain).

Both are measurable, but not 100% defined. A blog post every week doesn't mean that I have to publish something **valuable, technical** every week. It could also be some **random stuff**. The blog posts will be either [here](https://blog.benchr.de) or at my [swift blog](https://swift.benchr.de). Some (or maybe a lot of those) posts will be related to the second challenge.

I bought the freshly released book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com) and really enjoyed the first chapters so far. I learned the basics of **compiler and interpreters** during the exam phase of my bachelor degree and even created a very [basic compiler for the language pl0](https://github.com/BenchR267/pl0Compiler) during that time (Please don't look at the code ðŸ™ˆ). I definitely want to know more about that.

I want to get a deeper understanding why the **Swift compiler** e.g. is crashing in some occasions. Furthermore, I would like to know what I can do to fix these bugs. Building a compiler is a very low level task that is also very **performance critical**, so it's quite challenging and fits perfectly.

In this very moment, I don't want to define how **complex** that programming language is and what the features are. It will probably be a bit more than that pl0-thing on my [Github](https://github.com/BenchR267), but of course it will not be as complex as modern compilers. I am giving you a further definition in future posts.

For now, that's all I want to write. So thanks for reading my first blog entry! Moreover, I'm very curious what you want to achieve this year! Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benchr).

Thanks very much to my sister [Anne](https://www.instagram.com/anne_fridolina/) who helped me a lot on the language side of this post!

Todays blog post is less technical than the previous ones. I would like to talk about some events that happened in the last time. 

I am a registered Apple developer since November 2013. Since then I collected a lot of experiences, built a lot of apps and gained a ton of knowledge. But every product I built was for someone else, no matter if it was a company or a person. Even the first app I built *[(the iOS app for my university HTW Dresden)](https://www.htw-dresden.de/studium/studierende/htw-dresden-app.html)* was not published via my personal account but an enterprise account of the university.

Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with building apps for others and I am very proud of every app I built or contributed to, especially the ones that are used by [thousands](https://www.htw-dresden.de/studium/studierende/htw-dresden-app.html) or even [millions](https://www.lovoo.com) of people. But over the years I payed nearly 400â‚¬ just for being registered at Apples developer program without using the service like it should be used: for submitting apps.

Last week I had a crazy idea, I wondered what Apple thinks about [Get Schwifty]({{<ref "post/13-Get-Schwifty.md" >}}). They already accepted versions of it for beta testing via Testflight before *(with one exception because I used the Swift logo as app icon)* but that does not mean they would also approve it for the App Store. So I added a must-have feature: the ability to stop running scripts. I changed the info text from *'thanks for testing Get Schwifty'* to *'thanks for using Get Schwifty'*. I filled out the necessary information in iTunesConnect *(since I have no dedicated website for the app I named this blog instead)* and clicked on *Submit to Review*.

Just a day later Apple really approved my app, so I am thrilled to announce that ['Get Schwifty'](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/get-schwifty/id1222398681?l=en&mt=8) is now available on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/get-schwifty/id1222398681?l=en&mt=8). I am also really glad to work on a new feature which was initiated by a [pull request](https://github.com/BenchR267/Get-Schwifty/pull/10) on Github.

I am also very excited to announce another project which I had planned together with [Dominik](http://swiftandpainless.com). We had the idea back in October last year. We wanted to create a German podcast about iOS, macOS, Objective-C and Swift-development. We have a lot of ideas and topics for future episodes so we just started recording the first one which is already available in our [RSS-Feed](https://pcr.apple.com/id1225721421).

The first episode is about WWDC about which I also talked in a [previous blog post]({{<ref "post/13-Get-Schwifty.md" >}}) before. I am really excited where this journey will bring us. The next episode is already planned and we will have a great guest in the show. The episode will hit your podcast player *(I recommend [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?l=en&mt=8))* on 24th of April if you subscribed to our feed. ðŸ˜¬

Thanks for reading this far! The next blog post will have a technical topic again, Typscript! Stay tuned and whish me luck for this week's friday which is the day Apple announces the scholarship winners for this years WWDC.

Today I wrote my **last exam** for this semester; so I am finally **done** with this **stressful** time. It feels like it is getting harder every time to concentrate only on the topics that are **necessary** to pass every single exam. Especially in this time my head is full of motivation for a lot of different projects but I am forcing myself to not start any of them during the exam period. I just do not want to distract myself from the *important* topics with other **more interesting** ones.

I am very **glad** that I can now concentrate on all these projects. In this blog post I want to talk about some things I have planned in the near future. First of all I have **'holidays'**. That means there are no lectures until the **18th of March**. But I do not have free time because during this time I have **no limitations** on the amount of hours I can go to work. So if there is enough to do for me I will spend a lot of time in the **office** creating cool stuff for [LOVOO](https://www.lovoo.com).

On the **21st** of March I will give a [talk](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cocoaheads-Dresden/events/237722653/) about [**React Native**](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). I am really hyped by this framework currently and glad to make it a topic to bring the [**Cocoaheads Dresden**](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cocoaheads-Dresden/) together after months of silence. React Native will also be a topic for a blog post later in March I guess. The talk itself will be **recorded** and uploaded to Youtube but the video will be in **german**.

Something I am also **very excited** about is to start working on my [**compiler**]({{< ref "post/A_New_Beginning.md" >}}). In the **next week** I want to start writing a first implementation of the **Lexer**. **Later this week** I will publish another blog post that contains all necessary information about the project. Especially which **language** I will use and where to find the **repository**.

Beside that I would like to continue and start **reading** some nice books. I am currently reading those two on my [Kindle](http://amzn.to/2m7fLsH):

- [The Go Programming Language](http://amzn.to/2mbzxjd)
- [Without Their Permission](http://amzn.to/2m6VLq2)

Those are the two books I plan to read afterwards:

- [Poke the Box](http://amzn.to/2kLdrqW)
- [Zero to One](http://amzn.to/2lugK2M)

*(The links for the Kindle and the books are affiliate links to Amazon. So if you buy anything by clicking them I get a few cents. Feel free to not use them by searching the titles on Amazon.)*

Something else that I really **want to talk** *shortly* about is a project my friend [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabianehlert) published with his friend [Rikke](https://twitter.com/Rikkekoblauch). The app they build helps people that have social anxieties. It is called [**Steps**](https://www.stepsapp.xyz) and helps you by challenging yourself on a daily basis. You have a list of **challenges** from different categories to choose from. You can save them in your private list and complete them by solving a *simple* **task** like 'asking a stranger to take a photo of yourself'. This is something that sounds **easy** but might **not** be if you have social anxieties. You can read more about the topic [**here**](https://medium.com/steps/launching-steps-app-29bcc6fb20cd#.yg6kmqeaa) and vote for them on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com) [**here**](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/steps-3).

Thanks for reading this blog post and I hope your are nearly as excited as I am about the future. See you later this week!

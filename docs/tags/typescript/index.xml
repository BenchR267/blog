      <description>In this blog post I am going to write about a programming language which I have not checked out before. Typescript is a super set of Javascript and is developed by Microsoft. The syntax is exactly the same as Javascript with one very important difference: in comparison to Javascript Typescript knows the concept of types and checks them with a built in type system.
To make type failure messages more useful Typescript is also a compiled language while Javascript is an interpreted language.</description>

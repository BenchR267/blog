      <description>Since I am currently right before examination period time at my studies, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take a moment to talk about something I learned during the development of a task for my university. While the task itself was not that exciting, I think the overall principle is very nice!
The tool is a framework for developing new programming languages! Its name is Xtext. While I will propably never use it, I like the idea behind it.</description>

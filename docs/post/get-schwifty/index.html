    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Each year Apple organizes a conference for their third party platform developers. The conference is called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> <em>(world wide developers conference)</em> and takes place in California, USA. Although the tickets are extremly expensive <em>(1,599$ each)</em> it is almost impossible to get the chance to buy one due to the mass of people who try their luck.</p>

<p>The conference is all about the software; Apple uses the opening keynote to introduce the new major versions of their platform operating systems, iOS and macOS. The rest of the week there are a ton of talks given by Apple employees plus labs where you can talk one to one to the developers who build the SDKs and tools you use every day.</p>

<p>Attending WWDC is propably every iOS/macOS developer&rsquo;s dream and so it is mine. Fortunately, Apple has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/">special treatment</a> for pupils, students and members of STEM organizations. Last year I send an application for a scholarship which would have allowed me to visit the conference for free. Unfortunately, I did not win the scholarship but my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kiliankoe">Kilian</a> did which made me happy as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benchr.de/images/posts/schwifty.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead of visiting WWDC I had the great opportunity to attend <a href="http://altconf.com">AltConf</a> which was taking place in San Francisco during the time of WWDC last year. I am incredible happy about the chance I got. Being in San Francisco during a time where thousands of people around you who love the same things as you do is awesome. I collected a ton of invaluable experiences and met a lot of very interesting people. Some of them I am very proud to call my friends.</p>

<p>Although AltConf was really interesting and definitely worth the visit it was kind of sad to see all the people with badges go into the toward building each morning.</p>

<p>Later in October last year I started my master studies which means I am still a student and able to apply for a scholarship again. Having my experiences from last year in mind it was clear that I needed to try my luck. The only problems I had were the financial load of buying a plane ticket to the most expensive place in the world and staying there for the week. This is still a problem but it is one which I try to figure out if I get the chance to.</p>

<p>And that brings me to the original intend of this blog post: I am extremely proud to present you the project I built as an application for this year&rsquo;s WWDC scholarship. The task was to build some visually interactive scene using Swift Playgrounds, a part of Xcode and seperate app on iPad. There are literally infinite possibilities which makes it really hard to get the right idea. When Swift was firstly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO7Ta0DvEWA">announced</a> Chris Lattner <em>(the inventor of Swift)</em> built a SpriteKit scene in Playgrounds. That was very impressive and so my first thought was to build a graphical scene as well. But it turns out that graphical three dimensional scenes are not my biggest strength.</p>

<p>If you started reading this blog from the <a href="https://blog.benchr.de/post/beginning/">beginning</a> you may know that I like to overthink complex problems and learn new things. You may also have read that I wanted to build my own compiler for a new programming language, <a href="https://blog.benchr.de/post/mvp-lexer/">lbd</a>. Having this in mind I came to the conclusion that the Playground itself is the best interactive scene I know. So I started implementing my own.</p>

<p>Due to security reasons it is not possible to write, compile and run binaries inside iOS apps. But it is possible to evaluate Javascript using a framework called JavaScriptCore! That is it!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.benchr.de/images/posts/schwifty.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I built a lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree and a Javascript generator plus some user interface and a small wrapper around JavaScriptCore. The result is pretty impressive <em>(especially for 2-3 days of work)</em> and I am very proud about it. Today I would like to open source the repository to be open for contributions and the possibility for others to learn.</p>

<p>I do not think that this project will stay as a weekend hackathon project but will grow in the future. The potential is literally endless because it is not possible for me to implement all features that a team of professionals at Apple creates. And that it is totally okay! The app is not meant to replace something; it is just an addition to try out the language on the go.</p>

<p>If you would like to pre-alpha test the app send me a direct message on <a href="https://twitter.com/benchr">Twitter</a>. Feel also free to check out the repository on <a href="https://github.com/BenchR267/Get-Schwifty">Github</a>! Thanks for reading this blog post, I am really thrilled about the future! Wish me luck for the scholarship lottery, announcement is on April 21.</p>

<p>PS: The name is inspired by this great episode of Rick and Morty:</p>
